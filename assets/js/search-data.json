Word Vectors are often used as a fundamental component for downstream NLP tasks, e.g. question answering, text generation, translation, etc., so it is important to build some intuitions as to their strengths and weaknesses. Here, you will explore two types of word vectors: those derived from co-occurrence matrices, and those derived via GloVe. . Note on Terminology: The terms &quot;word vectors&quot; and &quot;word embeddings&quot; are often used interchangeably. The term &quot;embedding&quot; refers to the fact that we are encoding aspects of a word&#39;s meaning in a lower dimensional space. As Wikipedia states, &quot;conceptually it involves a mathematical embedding from a space with one dimension per word to a continuous vector space with a much lower dimension&quot;. . Part 1: Count-Based Word Vectors (10 points) . Most word vector models start from the following idea: . You shall know a word by the company it keeps (Firth, J. R. 1957:11) . Many word vector implementations are driven by the idea that similar words, i.e., (near) synonyms, will be used in similar contexts. As a result, similar words will often be spoken or written along with a shared subset of words, i.e., contexts. By examining these contexts, we can try to develop embeddings for our words. With this intuition in mind, many &quot;old school&quot; approaches to constructing word vectors relied on word counts. Here we elaborate upon one of those strategies, co-occurrence matrices (for more information, see here or here). . Co-Occurrence . A co-occurrence matrix counts how often things co-occur in some environment. Given some word $w_i$ occurring in the document, we consider the context window surrounding $w_i$. Supposing our fixed window size is $n$, then this is the $n$ preceding and $n$ subsequent words in that document, i.e. words $w_{i-n} dots w_{i-1}$ and $w_{i+1} dots w_{i+n}$. We build a co-occurrence matrix $M$, which is a symmetric word-by-word matrix in which $M_{ij}$ is the number of times $w_j$ appears inside $w_i$&#39;s window among all documents. . Example: Co-Occurrence with Fixed Window of n=1: . Document 1: &quot;all that glitters is not gold&quot; . Document 2: &quot;all is well that ends well&quot; . * &lt;START&gt; all that glitters is not gold well ends &lt;END&gt; . &lt;START&gt; | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | . all | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | . that | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | . glitters | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | . is | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | . not | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | . gold | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | . well | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | . ends | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | . &lt;END&gt; | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | . Note: In NLP, we often add &lt;START&gt; and &lt;END&gt; tokens to represent the beginning and end of sentences, paragraphs or documents. In this case we imagine &lt;START&gt; and &lt;END&gt; tokens encapsulating each document, e.g., &quot;&lt;START&gt; All that glitters is not gold &lt;END&gt;&quot;, and include these tokens in our co-occurrence counts. . The rows (or columns) of this matrix provide one type of word vectors (those based on word-word co-occurrence), but the vectors will be large in general (linear in the number of distinct words in a corpus). Thus, our next step is to run dimensionality reduction. In particular, we will run SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), which is a kind of generalized PCA (Principal Components Analysis) to select the top $k$ principal components. Here&#39;s a visualization of dimensionality reduction with SVD. In this picture our co-occurrence matrix is $A$ with $n$ rows corresponding to $n$ words. We obtain a full matrix decomposition, with the singular values ordered in the diagonal $S$ matrix, and our new, shorter length-$k$ word vectors in $U_k$. . This reduced-dimensionality co-occurrence representation preserves semantic relationships between words, e.g. doctor and hospital will be closer than doctor and dog. . Notes: If you can barely remember what an eigenvalue is, here&#39;s a slow, friendly introduction to SVD. If you want to learn more thoroughly about PCA or SVD, feel free to check out lectures 7, 8, and 9 of CS168. These course notes provide a great high-level treatment of these general purpose algorithms. Though, for the purpose of this class, you only need to know how to extract the k-dimensional embeddings by utilizing pre-programmed implementations of these algorithms from the numpy, scipy, or sklearn python packages. In practice, it is challenging to apply full SVD to large corpora because of the memory needed to perform PCA or SVD. However, if you only want the top $k$ vector components for relatively small $k$ — known as Truncated SVD — then there are reasonably scalable techniques to compute those iteratively. . Plotting Co-Occurrence Word Embeddings . Here, we will be using the Reuters (business and financial news) corpus. If you haven&#39;t run the import cell at the top of this page, please run it now (click it and press SHIFT-RETURN). The corpus consists of 10,788 news documents totaling 1.3 million words. These documents span 90 categories and are split into train and test. For more details, please see https://www.nltk.org/book/ch02.html. We provide a read_corpus function below that pulls out only articles from the &quot;grain&quot; (i.e. news articles about corn, wheat, etc.) category. The function also adds &lt;START&gt; and &lt;END&gt; tokens to each of the documents, and lowercases words. You do not have to perform any other kind of pre-processing. . def read_corpus(category=&quot;grain&quot;): &quot;&quot;&quot; Read files from the specified Reuter&#39;s category. Params: category (string): category name Return: list of lists, with words from each of the processed files &quot;&quot;&quot; files = reuters.fileids(category) return [[START_TOKEN] + [w.lower() for w in list(reuters.words(f))] + [END_TOKEN] for f in files] . Let&#39;s have a look what these documents are like…. . reuters_corpus = read_corpus() pprint.pprint(reuters_corpus[:3], compact=True, width=100) . .

Question 1.1: Implement distinct_words [code] (2 points) . Write a method to work out the distinct words (word types) that occur in the corpus. You can do this with for loops, but it&#39;s more efficient to do it with Python list comprehensions. In particular, this may be useful to flatten a list of lists. If you&#39;re not familiar with Python list comprehensions in general, here&#39;s more information. . Your returned corpus_words should be sorted. You can use python&#39;s sorted function for this. . You may find it useful to use Python sets to remove duplicate words. . def distinct_words(corpus): &quot;&quot;&quot; Determine a list of distinct words for the corpus.

Question 1.2: Implement compute_co_occurrence_matrix [code] (3 points) . Write a method that constructs a co-occurrence matrix for a certain window-size $n$ (with a default of 4), considering words $n$ before and $n$ after the word in the center of the window. Here, we start to use numpy (np) to represent vectors, matrices, and tensors. If you&#39;re not familiar with NumPy, there&#39;s a NumPy tutorial in the second half of this cs231n Python NumPy tutorial. . def compute_co_occurrence_matrix(corpus, window_size=4): &quot;&quot;&quot; Compute co-occurrence matrix for the given corpus and window_size (default of 4). Note: Each word in a document should be at the center of a window. Words near edges will have a smaller number of co-occurring words. For example, if we take the document &quot;&lt;START&gt; All that glitters is not gold &lt;END&gt;&quot; with window size of 4, &quot;All&quot; will co-occur with &quot;&lt;START&gt;&quot;, &quot;that&quot;, &quot;glitters&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, and &quot;not&quot;.

Question 1.3: Implement reduce_to_k_dim [code] (1 point) . Construct a method that performs dimensionality reduction on the matrix to produce k-dimensional embeddings. Use SVD to take the top k components and produce a new matrix of k-dimensional embeddings. . Note: All of numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn (sklearn) provide some implementation of SVD, but only scipy and sklearn provide an implementation of Truncated SVD, and only sklearn provides an efficient randomized algorithm for calculating large-scale Truncated SVD. So please use sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD. . def reduce_to_k_dim(M, k=2): &quot;&quot;&quot; Reduce a co-occurence count matrix of dimensionality (num_corpus_words, num_corpus_words) to a matrix of dimensionality (num_corpus_words, k) using the following SVD function from Scikit-Learn: - http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD.html Params: M (numpy matrix of shape (number of unique words in the corpus , number of unique words in the corpus)): co-occurence matrix of word counts k (int): embedding size of each word after dimension reduction Return: M_reduced (numpy matrix of shape (number of corpus words, k)): matrix of k-dimensioal word embeddings.

Question 1.4: Implement plot_embeddings [code] (1 point) . Here you will write a function to plot a set of 2D vectors in 2D space. For graphs, we will use Matplotlib (plt). . For this example, you may find it useful to adapt this code. In the future, a good way to make a plot is to look at the Matplotlib gallery, find a plot that looks somewhat like what you want, and adapt the code they give. . def plot_embeddings(M_reduced, word2ind, words): &quot;&quot;&quot; Plot in a scatterplot the embeddings of the words specified in the list &quot;words&quot;.

Question 1.5: Co-Occurrence Plot Analysis [written] (3 points) . Now we will put together all the parts you have written! We will compute the co-occurrence matrix with fixed window of 4 (the default window size), over the Reuters &quot;grain&quot; corpus. Then we will use TruncatedSVD to compute 2-dimensional embeddings of each word. TruncatedSVD returns U*S, so we need to normalize the returned vectors, so that all the vectors will appear around the unit circle (therefore closeness is directional closeness). Note: The line of code below that does the normalizing uses the NumPy concept of broadcasting. If you don&#39;t know about broadcasting, check out Computation on Arrays: Broadcasting by Jake VanderPlas. . Run the below cell to produce the plot. It&#39;ll probably take a few seconds to run.

Part 2: Prediction-Based Word Vectors (15 points) . As discussed in class, more recently prediction-based word vectors have demonstrated better performance, such as word2vec and GloVe (which also utilizes the benefit of counts). Here, we shall explore the embeddings produced by GloVe. Please revisit the class notes and lecture slides for more details on the word2vec and GloVe algorithms. If you&#39;re feeling adventurous, challenge yourself and try reading GloVe&#39;s original paper. . Then run the following cells to load the GloVe vectors into memory. Note: If this is your first time to run these cells, i.e. download the embedding model, it will take a couple minutes to run. If you&#39;ve run these cells before, rerunning them will load the model without redownloading it, which will take about 1 to 2 minutes. . def load_embedding_model(): &quot;&quot;&quot; Load GloVe Vectors Return: wv_from_bin: All 400000 embeddings, each lengh 200 &quot;&quot;&quot; import gensim.downloader as api wv_from_bin = api.load(&quot;glove-wiki-gigaword-200&quot;) print(&quot;Loaded vocab size %i&quot; % len(wv_from_bin.key_to_index.keys())) #len(list(wv_from_bin.wv.index_to_key))) return wv_from_bin . .

Write your answer here. . Cosine Similarity . Now that we have word vectors, we need a way to quantify the similarity between individual words, according to these vectors. One such metric is cosine-similarity. We will be using this to find words that are &quot;close&quot; and &quot;far&quot; from one another. . We can think of n-dimensional vectors as points in n-dimensional space. If we take this perspective L1 and L2 Distances help quantify the amount of space &quot;we must travel&quot; to get between these two points. Another approach is to examine the angle between two vectors. . Instead of computing the actual angle, we can leave the similarity in terms of $similarity = cos( Theta)$. Formally the Cosine Similarity $s$ between two vectors $p$ and $q$ is defined as: . $$s = frac{p cdot q}{||p|| ||q||}, textrm{ where } s in [-1, 1] $$ . Question 2.2: Words with Multiple Meanings (1.5 points) [code + written] . Polysemes and homonyms are words that have more than one meaning (see this wiki page to learn more about the difference between polysemes and homonyms ). Find a word with at least two different meanings such that the top-10 most similar words (according to cosine similarity) contain related words from both meanings. For example, &quot;leaves&quot; has both &quot;go_away&quot; and &quot;a_structure_of_a_plant&quot; meaning in the top 10, and &quot;scoop&quot; has both &quot;handed_waffle_cone&quot; and &quot;lowdown&quot;. You will probably need to try several polysemous or homonymic words before you find one. . Please state the word you discover and the multiple meanings that occur in the top 10. Why do you think many of the polysemous or homonymic words you tried didn&#39;t work (i.e. the top-10 most similar words only contain one of the meanings of the words)? . Note: You should use the wv_from_bin.most_similar(word) function to get the top 10 similar words. This function ranks all other words in the vocabulary with respect to their cosine similarity to the given word.

Word vectors have been shown to sometimes exhibit the ability to solve analogies. . As an example, for the analogy &quot;man : grandfather :: woman : x&quot; (read: man is to grandfather as woman is to x), what is x? . In the cell below, we show you how to use word vectors to find x using the most_similar function from the GenSim documentation. The function finds words that are most similar to the words in the positive list and most dissimilar from the words in the negative list (while omitting the input words, which are often the most similar; see this paper).

Word2Vec은 구글의 Mikolov가 제안한 word embedding 방식으로 기존의 통계적인 임베딩 방식 (e.g. tf-idf)과 달리 딥러닝 기반 임베딩으로 유의미한 성과를 냈다. Word2Vec의 Bag-of-Words 모델로 이는 단어의 어순 상관없이 어휘 빈도를 고려하는 방법을 말한다. Word2Vec은 skipgram, cbow라는 두가지 훈련 방법을 제시했다. . reference | . Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space | CBOW . CBOW(Continuous Bag-of-Words)는 주어진 winodw내 고정된 수의 context words로(정확히 말해 해당 벡터들의 평균값으로) target word(중간 단어)를 맞추는 훈련 방식이다. 타겟 단어들은 모두 같은 weight를 공유한다. . Skip-gram . Skipgram은 CBOW와 정반대로 타겟 단어를 바탕으로 정해진 수의 앞뒤 단어들을 맞추는 모델이다. CBOW모다 훈련은 느리지만, 보다 적은 훈련 데이터 양으로도 좋은 성과를 내며, 빈도가 적은 단어도 보다 잘 표현한다고 한다. (그 이유는 CBOW는 1. 벡터의 평균을 내고 2. 타겟 단어 하나만 예측하기 때문에 아무래도 빈도가 높은 단어 위주로 예측하게 되기 때문에...?) 그래서 그런지 보통 skipgram으로 구현하는 경우가 많은 듯 하다. . 사전(10,000 단어)의 각 단어($w$)마다 target(중앙) 단어일 때의 벡터 $V_w$와 context 단어일 때의 벡터($U_w$)를 갖는다 ($V_w, U_w in mathbb{R^{300}} $). 현재 단어가 $C$일 때, $C$가 아닌 단어 $O$가 $C$의 앞뒤로 나타날 확률은 다음과 같이 정의한다. $$ P(O | C) = frac{exp({U_O}^ top V_C)}{ sum_{w}exp({U_w}^ top V_C)} $$ 즉 $U_O$, $V_C$의 내적(분자)을 통해 단어 O, C의 유사도를 구하고 이를 사전 전체를 두고 정규화(분모)한다. . 따라서 각 위치를 $t$라고 할 때 우도(likelihood)는 $$ 𝐿( theta) = prod_{t}^{T} prod_{-m leq j leq m}{P(W_{t+j} mid W_t ; theta)} space (j ne 0, m은 context size) $$ 이고 모델 전체의 cost는 negative log-likelilhood로서 $$ J( theta) = - frac{1}{T} log𝐿( theta)= - frac{1}{T} sum_{t} sum_{j} log{P(W_{t+j} mid W_t ; theta)} $$ 이다. (다만 위는 batch gradient descent임. 실제로는 대부분 SGD로 구현). Skipgram은 이 평균 로그 확률값을 줄이는 방향으로 훈련을 하게 된다. . . Note: 우도를 극대화 할수록 우도에 minus 씌운 cost는 극소화 된다. .

Negative Sampling . negative sampling 논문 | . Skip-gram은 타겟 단어 C와 컨텍스트 단어 O가 같이 나타나는 확률을 구하기 위해 C와 사전내 모든 어휘들의 내적을 구해야 된다(소프트맥스 함수를 쓰기 때문에). 사전의 크기만큼 전산이 필요하다는 단점을 극복하기 위해 Mikolov가 제시한 방법 중 하나가 negative sampling이다. &lt;/br&gt; Negative sampling은 Noise Contrastive Estimation을 활용한 방식인데, 이는 좋은 모델이라면 노이즈 분포와 원래 데이터 분포를 구별해낼 수 있다는 전제를 기반으로 한다. 예를 들어 원래 데이터셋에 &quot;I like pizza&quot;라는 문장이 있고 타겟 단어가 &#39;like&#39;이며 window 크기가 1일 때, positive samples은 (like, I), (like, pizza)이다. 그런데 negative sampling은 (like, towoards)와 같은 negative samples, 즉 노이즈를 일부러 추가하여 모델에게 주어진 샘플이 원래 분포에 속하는지 아니면 노이즈 분포에 속하는지 logistic regression으로 판단하게 한다. . negative sampling objective . $$ log sigma({u_{w_O}}^ top v_{w_C}) + sum_{i=1}^{k} mathbb{E}_{w_i sim P_n{(w)}}[ log sigma ({-u_{w_i}}^ top v_{w_C})] $$ (k는 sampling size, $v$는 $w_C$가 타겟(인풋)일 때의 벡터, $u$는 $w_O$가 컨텍스트일 때의 벡터이다.) . . Note: 벡터 표기법이 논문에 따라 다르다. 지금까지 단어 w의 인풋 벡터는 $V_w$, 컨텍스트 벡터는 $U_w$라고 표기했는데, 아래에서는 각각 $v_{w_C}$, $u_{w_O}$로 표기한다. . . Note: 위 목적함수를 직관적으로 이해하기. $ log sigma({u_{w_O}}^ top v_{w_C})$는 두 벡터가 유사할수록(내적이 클수록) 0에 수렴한다. 그러나 $ sum_{i=1}^{k} mathbb{E}_{w_i sim P_n{(w)}}[ log sigma ({-u_{w_i}}^ top v_{w_C})]$에서는 두 벡터의 내적(i.e.${-u_{w_i}}^ top v_{w_C}$ )이 클수록 sigmoid 결과값은 0에 수렴하며, 결과적으로 $ log sigma ({-u_{w_i}}^ top v_{w_C})$ 는 $- infty$에 수렴한다. 즉 첫 항은 positive pair의 유사도로 maximize해야 하지만 두번째 항은 k개의 negative pairs의 유사도로 minimize해야 한다. k의 크기는 훈련 데이터셋 크기가 작을 때는 5~20, 클 때는 2~5로 충분하다고 한다. 다만 k개의 negative samples을 수집할 때 빈도가 높은 어휘(관사나 전치사 등)가 과수집되는 것을 막기 위해 노이즈 분포를 다음과 같이 정의해준다. $$ P_n(w)= frac{f(w)^{3/4}}{ sum_{i}^{V}f(w_i)^{3/4}} $$ frequency (Unigram)를 3/4 승하면 노이즈 분포를 완만하게 할 수 있는데, 이는 빈도가 극히 적은 어휘의 확률을 (예를 들어) 0.3에서 $0.405(=0.3^{3/4})$로 올려준다. . negative sampling loss and gradient . skip-gram처럼 목적함수의 negative를 negative sampling의 loss라고 하면 $$ J = - log sigma({u_{w_O}}^ top v_{w_C}) - sum_{i=1}^{k} mathbb{E}_{w_i sim P_n{(w)}}[ log sigma ({-u_{w_i}}^ top v_{w_C})] $$ 이고 따라서 center/target word vector에 대한 미분은 $$ frac{ partial J}{ partial v_{wC}} = - frac{1}{ sigma({u{wO}}^ top v{wC})} cdot sigma({u{wO}}^ top v{wC}) (1 - sigma({u{wO}}^ top v{wC})) cdot u{w_O} . sum{i=1}^{k} frac{1}{ sigma(-{u{wi}}^ top v{wC})} cdot sigma(-{u{wi}}^ top v{wC}) (1- sigma(-{u{wi}}^ top v{wC})) cdot -u{wi} =( sigma({u{wO}}^ top v{wC}) -1) cdot u{wO} + sum{i=1}^{k} (1- sigma(-{u_{wi}}^ top v{wC})) cdot u{wi} $$ context word vector에 대한 미분은 $$ frac{ partial J}{ partial u{wX}} = - (1 - sigma({u{wO}}^ top v{wC})) cdot frac{ partial}{ partial u{wX}} {u{wO}}^ top v{wC} - sum{i=1}^{k} (1- sigma(-{u_{wi}}^ top v{wC})) cdot frac{ partial}{ partial u{wX}} ({-u{wi}}^ top v{wC}) $$ 여기서 $u{wX} = u{w_O}$ 일 때는 (positive sample의 컨텍스트 단어 $wO$에 대한 미분) $$ frac{ partial J}{ partial u{wO}} = - (1 - sigma({u{wO}}^ top v{wC})) cdot v{wC} $$ 반면 $u{wX} = u{wi}$ 일 때는 (즉 negative sample의 컨텍스트 단어 하나에 대한 미분; k만큼 업데이트) $$ frac{ partial J}{ partial u{wi}} = (1 - sigma({-u{wO}}^ top v{wC})) cdot v{wC} (i는 1 cdots k) $$ 위에서 $u{wO} = u{w_i} $ 즉 컨텍스트 단어 하나가 positive pair와 동시에 negative pair로 추출될 수도 있다. 이때는 위 두식에 의해 두번 업데이트 된다. | . def negSamplingLossAndGradient( centerWordVec, outsideWordIdx, outsideVectors, dataset, K=10 ): &quot;&quot;&quot; Negative sampling loss function for word2vec models Implement the negative sampling loss and gradients for a centerWordVec and a outsideWordIdx word vector as a building block for word2vec models.

(GAN의 생성/구별 구조 활용) . 다각도의 논점 파악 | . 실제 개발 후 다양한 정치적 이슈로 실험해 보니, 내가 생각해 보지 못했던 논거를 제시하는 것을 보고 놀랐다. 후술하겠지만 총 여섯개(주요 일간지 5개 + 언론사 불특정)의 결과물을 모델이 생성하는데, 이 결과물들이 서로 다르다. 논술을 준비하는 학생들이 다양한 논거를 파악하거나, 기사 생성기가 최종 결과물을 결정할 때 비교할 수 있는 후보들을 확보할 수 있다. . 개발 환경 및 모델 선택 . pytorch, huggingface 라이브러리를 사용하여 개발하였다. 생성모델을 목표로 하였기 때문에 생성에 최적화된 GPT 모델 중 한국어로 훈련된 KoGPT2를 선택하게 되었다. 프로그래머스에서 매우 비싼 aws P3 인스턴스를 지원해 주었고, P3의 경우 16GB의 GPU가 달려 있기 때문에 카카오브레인에서 제공한 KoGPT를 파인튜닝 하려고 했다. 카카오의 모델이 SKT의 그것보다 배는 큰 모델인 만큼 아무래도 생성 결과물이 훨씬 자연스러웠기 때문이다. KoGPT측에서 말하는 최소 사양이 16GB라 아슬아슬하지만 문제는 없을 줄 알았는데, 문제는 이 최소사양이라는 게 추론(inference)을 위한 최소 사양이라는 것이었다. 즉 파인튜닝까지 하려면 더 큰 gpu가 필요했던 것이다. 허깅페이스에서 KoGPT의 사전 훈련된 웨이트를 다운받으면 12GB 정도 나오는데, 기본적으로 pytorch가 차지하는 GPU가 있는 모양이었다. GPU 사용을 최소화하려고 다음과 같은 기법(huggingface가 제공하는 방법들)을 사용했으나 메모리 부족은 여전했다. . batch 사이즈 줄임 (1까지…) | 변수 활용 최소화 (loss라는 변수 만들어서 iteration마다 누적 loss 측정하는 행위 등을 안함; 불가피하게 변수를 만들어야 할 경우 사용 후 바로 del ‘variable’, torch.cuda.empty_cache() 해줬음.) | gradient checkpointing (역전파를 위해 모든 unit의 함수를 저장하는 대신 일부만 저장; 시간은 늘어나나 메모리 활용은 줄어듬. 자세한 설명은 여기) | gradient accumulation (배치마다 업데이트 하지 않고 어느정도 누적함으로써 사실상 더 큰 batch로 훈련하는 효과를 누림.) | . 위의 기법을 다 활용하니 훈련 트레이닝 셋 배치를 토큰화하는 것도 안되다가 optimizer step에서 막히는 정도로 까지 메모리 최소화를 이뤄내긴 했다. 결론적으로 16GB의 램으로는 파인튜닝이 불가능해 카카오브레인을 포기하긴 했지만, 애초에 모델 임포트 자체로도 시간이 너무 걸리기 때문에 서비스용으로 적합하지 않았다 (그래서 teacher-student 구조로 knowledge distillation하려고 했으나 애초에 메모리 부족으로 훈련이 안됨…). 결국 SKT의 KoGPT2가 파인튜닝하고 서비스하기에 적합한 사이즈라고 판단하고 이를 기반으로 우리 모델을 만들기로 했다. . KoGPT-taf의 Tokenizer &amp; Model . SKT-KoGPT2가 사용하는 tokenizer 사전의 크기는 51,200이다. 그런데 KoGPT2의 경우 정치에 특화된 코퍼스에 훈련되지 않았기 때문에, ‘이명박’, ‘박근혜’, ‘문재인’, ‘윤석열’과 같은 주요 정치인의 이름은 물론 ‘청와대’와 같은 조직명과 ‘코로나’, ‘세월호’ 등 한국 정치사의 주요 사건을 하나의 토큰으로 인식하지 않는다. . 한국 정치에 특화된 모델을 지향하는 KoGPT-taf의 경우 정치 관련 주요 개체명을 따로 사전에 등록한 후 추가 훈련을 진행하였다. 추가할 개체명은 5개 주요 일간지별 만 개의 사설의 제목을 KoNLPy의 Komoran tagger로 분석, 명사만 추출한 후 빈도수를 측정하여 가장 빈도가 높은 고유명사들만 뽑아 선정하였다(불용어 + 의존명사는 제거함). . 참고로 빈도수 top 300개의 명사는 다음과 같다. (빈도수 추출 전 ) . # 빈도수 추출 전 다음과 같은 토큰을 불용어로 판단하고 제거 # [&#39;수&#39;, &#39;것&#39;, &#39;번&#39;, &#39;호&#39;, &#39;제&#39;, &#39;때&#39;, &#39;년&#39;, &#39;명&#39;, &#39;만&#39;, &#39;이번&#39;, &#39;인가&#39;] # top 300: [&#39;대통령&#39;, &#39;정부&#39;, &#39;국민&#39;, &#39;검찰&#39;, &#39;수사&#39;, &#39;미&#39;, &#39;정치&#39;, &#39;경제&#39;, &#39;일&#39;, &#39;한국&#39;, &#39;한&#39;, &#39;개혁&#39;, &#39;북&#39;, &#39;국회&#39;, &#39;대책&#39;, &#39;의혹&#39;, &#39;북한&#39;, &#39;청와대&#39;, &#39;법&#39;, &#39;책임&#39;, &#39;정책&#39;, &#39;정권&#39;, &#39;선거&#39;, &#39;말&#39;, &#39;필요&#39;, &#39;문제&#39;, &#39;박&#39;, &#39;위기&#39;, &#39;중&#39;, &#39;민주당&#39;, &#39;핵&#39;, &#39;장관&#39;, &#39;대화&#39;, &#39;안&#39;, &#39;계기&#39;, &#39;남북&#39;, &#39;후보&#39;, &#39;대선&#39;, &#39;사회&#39;, &#39;미국&#39;, &#39;대표&#39;, &#39;일본&#39;, &#39;나라&#39;, &#39;박근혜&#39;, &#39;문&#39;, &#39;조사&#39;, &#39;국정&#39;, &#39;코로나&#39;, &#39;비리&#39;, &#39;국가&#39;, &#39;기업&#39;, &#39;원전&#39;, &#39;중국&#39;, &#39;의원&#39;, &#39;사태&#39;, &#39;차&#39;, &#39;대응&#39;, &#39;대북&#39;, &#39;논란&#39;, &#39;국정원&#39;, &#39;외교&#39;, &#39;세월호&#39;, &#39;관계&#39;, &#39;인사&#39;, &#39;우려&#39;, &#39;사건&#39;, &#39;합의&#39;, &#39;이유&#39;, &#39;총리&#39;, &#39;야당&#39;, &#39;기대&#39;, &#39;사드&#39;, &#39;게&#39;, &#39;교육&#39;, &#39;원&#39;, &#39;시장&#39;, &#39;시대&#39;, &#39;여당&#39;, &#39;갈등&#39;, &#39;불법&#39;, &#39;안전&#39;, &#39;여야&#39;, &#39;안보&#39;, &#39;정상회담&#39;, &#39;평화&#39;, &#39;노조&#39;, &#39;금융&#39;, &#39;당&#39;, &#39;중단&#39;, &#39;규명&#39;, &#39;시민&#39;, &#39;역사&#39;, &#39;트럼프&#39;, &#39;돈&#39;, &#39;경찰&#39;, &#39;언론&#39;, &#39;김정은&#39;, &#39;협상&#39;, &#39;사과&#39;, &#39;세계&#39;, &#39;정상&#39;, &#39;방역&#39;, &#39;대&#39;, &#39;총장&#39;, &#39;권력&#39;, &#39;복지&#39;, &#39;길&#39;, &#39;속&#39;, &#39;통합&#39;, &#39;노동&#39;, &#39;세금&#39;, &#39;지원&#39;, &#39;현실&#39;, &#39;일자리&#39;, &#39;시작&#39;, &#39;혁신&#39;, &#39;판결&#39;, &#39;사퇴&#39;, &#39;논의&#39;, &#39;부동산&#39;, &#39;공무원&#39;, &#39;재벌&#39;, &#39;회담&#39;, &#39;이제&#39;, &#39;자&#39;, &#39;새누리당&#39;, &#39;방송&#39;, &#39;강화&#39;, &#39;결정&#39;, &#39;한반도&#39;, &#39;공약&#39;, &#39;인권&#39;, &#39;위&#39;, &#39;삼성&#39;, &#39;예산&#39;, &#39;해결&#39;, &#39;개입&#39;, &#39;주목&#39;, &#39;해법&#39;, &#39;비핵화&#39;, &#39;미래&#39;, &#39;특검&#39;, &#39;고용&#39;, &#39;참사&#39;, &#39;말라&#39;, &#39;선언&#39;, &#39;불안&#39;, &#39;민심&#39;, &#39;발언&#39;, &#39;자격&#39;, &#39;힘&#39;, &#39;끝&#39;, &#39;성장&#39;, &#39;문재인&#39;, &#39;거부&#39;, &#39;조작&#39;, &#39;확대&#39;, &#39;안철수&#39;, &#39;규제&#39;, &#39;조국&#39;, &#39;대비&#39;, &#39;법원&#39;, &#39;식&#39;, &#39;실패&#39;, &#39;사고&#39;, &#39;개편&#39;, &#39;윤석열&#39;, &#39;정당&#39;, &#39;교과서&#39;, &#39;시간&#39;, &#39;진실&#39;, &#39;건&#39;, &#39;씨&#39;, &#39;보수&#39;, &#39;군&#39;, &#39;4대강&#39;, &#39;요구&#39;, &#39;부실&#39;, &#39;소득&#39;, &#39;진상&#39;, &#39;반대&#39;, &#39;앞&#39;, &#39;위험&#39;, &#39;민주&#39;, &#39;공천&#39;, &#39;정&#39;, &#39;후보자&#39;, &#39;청년&#39;, &#39;사업&#39;, &#39;신뢰&#39;, &#39;은행&#39;, &#39;경고&#39;, &#39;변화&#39;, &#39;간&#39;, &#39;아베&#39;, &#39;과제&#39;, &#39;전환&#39;, &#39;검사&#39;, &#39;개선&#39;, &#39;대한민국&#39;, &#39;협력&#39;, &#39;서울&#39;, &#39;공개&#39;, &#39;사법&#39;, &#39;이상&#39;, &#39;국제&#39;, &#39;방치&#39;, &#39;사람&#39;, &#39;투표&#39;, &#39;포기&#39;, &#39;인상&#39;, &#39;대학&#39;, &#39;폐지&#39;, &#39;자유&#39;, &#39;백신&#39;, &#39;관리&#39;, &#39;연금&#39;, &#39;최저임금&#39;, &#39;총선&#39;, &#39;제재&#39;, &#39;탄핵&#39;, &#39;폭력&#39;, &#39;처리&#39;, &#39;도발&#39;, &#39;뿐&#39;, &#39;약속&#39;, &#39;대기업&#39;, &#39;경쟁&#39;, &#39;한국당&#39;, &#39;쇄신&#39;, &#39;전&#39;, &#39;미사일&#39;, &#39;금리&#39;, &#39;전략&#39;, &#39;텐가&#39;, &#39;인식&#39;, &#39;원칙&#39;, &#39;확인&#39;, &#39;외면&#39;, &#39;종&#39;, &#39;의지&#39;, &#39;피해&#39;, &#39;기회&#39;, &#39;등&#39;, &#39;노동자&#39;, &#39;이후&#39;, &#39;확산&#39;, &#39;위원장&#39;, &#39;손&#39;, &#39;사찰&#39;, &#39;학교&#39;, &#39;전쟁&#39;, &#39;공공&#39;, &#39;실&#39;, &#39;세&#39;, &#39;집값&#39;, &#39;재판&#39;, &#39;재난&#39;, &#39;입법&#39;, &#39;충격&#39;, &#39;단&#39;, &#39;제도&#39;, &#39;기관&#39;, &#39;적극&#39;, &#39;남&#39;, &#39;공정&#39;, &#39;추진&#39;, &#39;정신&#39;, &#39;테러&#39;, &#39;처&#39;, &#39;위안부&#39;, &#39;뒤&#39;, &#39;강행&#39;, &#39;탓&#39;, &#39;경영&#39;, &#39;파업&#39;, &#39;검증&#39;, &#39;공수&#39;, &#39;철회&#39;, &#39;보호&#39;, &#39;완화&#39;, &#39;이&#39;, &#39;성공&#39;, &#39;회장&#39;, &#39;걱정&#39;, &#39;전면&#39;, &#39;공단&#39;, &#39;진보&#39;, &#39;비판&#39;, &#39;운동&#39;, &#39;범죄&#39;, &#39;단체&#39;, &#39;학생&#39;, &#39;산업&#39;, &#39;집단&#39;, &#39;근본&#39;, &#39;군사&#39;, &#39;농&#39;, &#39;기준&#39;, &#39;판사&#39;] . 이중 최근 중요도를 임의로 판단하여 “박근혜”, “트럼프”, “김정은”, “문재인”, “안철수”, “윤석열”, “이명박”, “코로나”, “세월호”, “사드”, “새누리당”, “4대강”, “청와대”를 사전에 등록하였다. . 이에 KoGPT-taf의 토크나이저의 사전과 모델의 임베딩 레이어의 크기가 SKT-KoGPT2에 비해 13개 증가였다. .

Model . model type # of hidden # of layers and heads 최대 생성 길이 . GPT2 | 768 | 12 | 128 토큰 | . 모델 훈련 . KoGPT2를 실험해 본 결과 그대로 활용하기엔 아쉬운 점이 몇몇 보였다. . 많이 부족한 생성 결과 | . 말그대로 부자연스러운 생성물이 많았다. . 뉴스라기엔 격식이 떨어지는 말투 | . 많은 대언어모델들이 그렇듯 웹문서를 마구잡이로 수집해 만든 코퍼스로 훈련되었기 때문에 생성물의 register가 뉴스의 그것과 달랐다. . 사실과 다른 결과물 | . 21년 상반기에 공개된 모델인만큼 KoGPT2는 ‘예전’의 문서들로 훈련되었는데, 이에 따라 현재의 정치적 상황과 다른 결과물이 여럿 발견되었다 (예를 들어 ‘전 대통령 박근혜’ 대신 ‘대통령 박근혜’라든지 박근혜 정부 때 얘기하면서 문 정부 때의 ‘박수현 대변인’을 제시하는 등). 즉 최신의 뉴스 문서들로 추가 훈련할 필요가 있었다. . 무엇보다 BERT나 OpenAI GPT가 모델의 크기에 비해 과소적합되어 있다면서 추가로 훈련을 진행하거나, 더 큰 데이터셋으로 훈련을 시킨 경우가 있었던 만큼(ALBERT 등) 우리 모델도 KoGPT2를 단순히 파인튜닝 수준이 아니라 추가로 훈련시키기로 했다. . 추가 language modeling 훈련 . KoGPT2의 웨이트를 불러온 후, 국립국어원 모두의 말뭉치의 ‘신문 말뭉치 2021’(4.4GB)의 본문을 대상으로 언어모델링을 추가로 진행했다 (epoch:10, batch_size:32, learning_rate: 5e-5, context_length: 128). . fine-tuning . 이후에 epoch:5, learning_rate: 5e-5, context_length:128, batch_size:32로 파인튜닝을 진행했다. 이 때 사용한 데이터셋은 5대 일간지(중앙일보, 조선일보, 한겨레, 동아일보, 경향신문)의 사설 5만여개이다. 각 일간지별로 만여개씩 모았다. 사실 만여개씩 모으면 대략 최근 4-5년치 정도가 되지 않을까 했는데, 실제로 모아보니 대략 10년치였다 (러프하게 계산해보면 언론사별로 1년에 1000개, 하루에 2~3개의 사설을 내는 것이다.) . 더 많은 최신의 신문 데이터를 확보하려면 사설뿐만 아니라 ‘정치’, ‘사회’, ‘경제’ 섹션의 기사들도 모으면 된다. 그런데도 사설만 모아 훈련시킨 이유는 매일매일 가장 주목을 받는 정치적 이슈에 대한 언론사의 대표적 입장이 가장 잘 드러나는 섹션이 사설이기 때문이다. 사설 또한 ‘오피니언’ 섹션의 일부이지만, ‘오피니언’은 말그대로 언론사의 입장과 정반대의 입장도 기고할 수 있는 곳이기 때문에 기자 개인의 이름이 아닌 사명을 달고 내는 사설만 활용하기로 했다. . 사설을 활용한 또다른 이유는 사설은 ‘팩트’ 뿐만 아니라 ‘주장’이 확실히 담고 있기 때문이다. 물론 일반 보도 기사 역시 기자와 편집부의 의견이 간접적으로 담기기는 하지만 대부분의 문장에 가치판단이 빠져 있으나 (e.g. “문재인 대통령은 지난 2일 ~~라고 말했다”, “중대재해법을 어기면 ~한 처벌을 받을 수 있다” 등), 사설에는 어떤 이슈에 대한 가치판단이 담긴 문장이 분명히 나타날 수 밖에 없다. . 128 토큰으로 잘라진 ‘[언론사명]:[사설 내용 일부](e.g. “조선일보:더 심각한 문제는 북한의 의료·방역 수준…”)’ 형태의 배치로 훈련되어 이슈별 언론사별 입장을 학습하도록 했다. .",
